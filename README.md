# Deep NLP Course at ABBYY

The crash course to the deep learning for NLP at ABBYY.

The textbook: [Neural Network Methods in Natural Language Processing by Yoav Goldberg](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Processing-Synthesis-Lectures-Technologies/dp/1627052984)

## Lecture Materials
### Lecture 1: *Introduction*  
A short overview of the most popular architectures in the deep learning.   
A brief introduction into the [keras](keras.io) framework.  
Examples of models for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset.  
The [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#fileId=1KGy9Hm3y4asE6ohg3QD77w2nZV3V9_08).

### Lecture 2: *Fully-Connected Neural Networks and Word2Vec Models*  
An introduction into the [PyTorch](pytorch.org) framework.   
Example of a simple bag-of-words model for the sentiment analysis.  
Examples of Word2Vec models: CBOW, Skip-Gram and Negative Sampling.

### Lecture 3: *Recurrent Neural Networks, part 1.*  
A simple implementation of the vanilla RNN and an illustration of the vanishing gradient problem.  
Examples of character-level LSTMs for:
- Text classification: language prediction by the surname's spelling;
- Conditional text generation: generation of the surname given language.
